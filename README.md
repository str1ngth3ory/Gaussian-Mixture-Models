# Setup

Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6601/assignment_5.git`

Please use the same environment from previous assignments by running

```
conda activate ai_env
```

#### Jupyter Notebook:
In order to complete this assignment, you will be using **jupyter notebook**.

To open the Jupyter Notebook, navigate to your assignment folder, (activate your environment if you have/using one), and run `jupyter notebook`. 

Project description and all of the functions required to implement you will find in the `solution.ipynb` file.

**ATTENTION:** You are free to add additional cells for debugging your implementation, however, please don't write any inline code in the cells with function declarations, only edit the section *inside* the function, which has comments like: `# TODO: finish this function`.

## Grading

The grade you receive for the assignment will be distributed as follows:

1. k-Means Clustering (19 points)
2. Gaussian Mixture Model (48 points)
3. Model Performance Improvements (20 points)
4. Bayesian Information Criterion (12 points)
5. Return your name (1 point)
6. Bonus (+5 points) (Bonus points are added to this assignment's grade and not to the overall grade.)

You can earn more than 100 points for the assignment if you complete the bonus part.

## Submission
The tests for the assignment are provided in `mixture_tests.py`, all of the tests are already embedded into the respective ipython notebook cells, so the will be running automaticagically when you run the cells with your code. Local tests are sufficient for verifying the correctness of your implementation. The tests on Gradescope will be similar to the ones provided here, but the images and data being tested against, and the values for calculations will be different.

In order to do get your submission file ready you will need to make sure have saved your notebook and run:

`python notebook2script.py submit`

Once execution is complete open autogenerated `submit/submission.py` and verify that it contains all of the imports, functions and classes you are required to implement. Only then you can proceed to the [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) for submission.

In your Gradescope submission history, you can mark a certain submission as **Active**. Please ensure this is your best submission.

#### Do NOT erase the #export at the top of any cells as it is used by notebook2script.py to extract cells for submission.

#### You will be allowed 3 submission every 3 hours on gradescope. Make sure you test everything before submitting. The code will be allowed to run for not more than 40 minutes per submission. In order for the code to run quickly, make sure to vectorize the code (more on this in the notebook itself).


## Resources

1. Udacity lectures on Unsupervised Learning (Lesson 7)
2. The `gaussians.pdf`  in the `read/` folder will introduce you to multivariate normal distributions.
3. A youtube video by Alexander Ihler, on multivariate EM algorithm details:

4. The `em.pdf` chapter in the `read/` folder. This will be especially useful for Part 2 of the assignment.
