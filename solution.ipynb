    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic image processing is a key component to many AI systems, including facial recognition and video compression, instance segmentation of images and point cloud data. One basic method for processing is segmentation, by which we divide an image into a fixed number of components in order to simplify its representation. For example, we can train a mixture of Gaussians to represent an image, and segment it according to the simplified representation as shown in the images below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/k6_Starry.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Or we could perform a clustering of point cloud in order to separate different objects, backgrounds etc, as shown in the image below\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/pcd_clustered.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will learn to perform image compression and point cloud segmentation. To this end, you will implement Gaussian mixture models and iteratively improve their performance. First you will perform segmentation on the \"Starry\" (`Starry.png`) and at the end run your algorithm on 3D point cloud data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, you will implement several methods of image segmentation, with increasing complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement k-means clustering to segment a color image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Familiarize yourself with the algorithm by running it on simple dataset.\n",

    "3. Build a Gaussian mixture model to be trained with expectation-maximization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Experiment with varying the details of the Gaussian mixture model’s implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Implement and test a new metric called the Bayesian information criterion, which guarantees a more robust image segmentation.\n",

    "## Part 0: Note on Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of Vectorization was introduced in the last section of Assignment 4. For this assignment, please vectorize your code wherever possible using numpy arrays, instead of running for-loops over the images being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example of how this might be useful, consider the following array:\n",
    "A = [12 34 1234 764 ...(has a million values)... 91, 78]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you need to calculate another array B, which has the same dimensions as A above. Say each value in B is calculated as follows:\n",
    "(each value in B) = square_root_of(some constants pi log(k) * (each value in A))/7\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wish to use a for-loop to compute this. However, it will take really long to run on an array of this magnitude.\n",
    "Alternatively, you may choose to use numpy and perform this calculation in a single line. You can pass A as a numpy array and the entire calculation will be done in a line, resulting in B being populated with the corresponding values that come out of this formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out **Basic Operation** section of the Numpy Tutorial if you are not familiar with numpy vector/matrix operations: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html#basic-operations\n",

    "One easy method for image segmentation is to simply cluster all similar data points together and then replace their values with the mean value. Thus, we'll warm up using k-means clustering. This will also provide a baseline to compare with your segmentation. Please note that clustering will come in handy later.\n",

    "- Segmentation here is done in purely unsupervised manner, you could manually combine multiple gaussian\n",
    "- How about merging multiple scenes into a single one? You could crop one segment from one scene and place it inside another scene.\n",
